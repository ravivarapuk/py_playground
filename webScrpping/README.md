#Web Scrapping

You can scrape data from any website but the question lies in your judgement because no one can stop you from scrapping their webpage. The best they can do is tell you what they are in approval of and what they aren't w.r.t whatever you are scrapping from their page.

To know what the owners of webpage are in approval of are you can just add **/robots.txt** to the end of the URL to see what they approve and dis-approve off.
